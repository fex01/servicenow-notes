## UX Impact and Value

- UX covers **all aspects** of an end user‚Äôs interaction with an organization, its IT services, and its products.
- Good UX is critical because:
  - It‚Äôs not limited to software but spans every point of interaction between individuals and their environment.
  - The human brain compares every experience ‚Äî digital and physical ‚Äî to other experiences (e.g., a walk in the forest or a day at the beach sets a baseline for positive experiences).
- UX influences:
  - User satisfaction
  - Adoption rates
  - Productivity
  - Brand perception

## Incorporating UX into Your Implementation

### Create a Commitment to UX

- User expectations for enterprise software = **consumer-grade** (intuitive, flexible, frictionless).
- Bad UX = lost productivity, low satisfaction, rework/redeployment costs.
- ServiceNow modernization:
  - **Next Experience** and **Employee Center Pro** modernize baseline UI.
- Commit to UX by:
  - Allocating time for user-centric design in configs/customizations.
  - Using ServiceNow‚Äôs out-of-the-box capabilities as a baseline.

## UX Leading Practices

  - Each practice connects directly to ServiceNow platform capabilities ‚Äî bridging guidance to action.
  - The practices explain ServiceNow‚Äôs design decisions ‚Äî use them to understand product design intent.

### Self-Service

- **Introduction**
  - Many users‚Äô first interaction with ServiceNow is self-service ‚Äî it sets expectations for usability and trust.
  - Good self-service reduces workload on support teams and builds user confidence.
- **Five leading practices:**
  - ‚úÖ Understand the Current State ‚Äî know how users perceive the experience before you start.
  - ‚úÖ Focus on Service Delivery ‚Äî trust comes from resolving requests fast and accurately.
  - ‚úÖ Ensure Information Finds the User ‚Äî design so relevant info reaches the user, not the other way around.
  - ‚úÖ Don‚Äôt Follow the Org Chart ‚Äî structure info by user needs, not by internal hierarchy.
  - ‚úÖ Prioritize Consumer over Providers ‚Äî design forms for novice users, not for system owners.
- **Common user impediments:**
  - Hard-to-find content ‚Äî navigation doesn‚Äôt match users‚Äô mental models.
  - Poor search relevancy ‚Äî search results fail to meet consumer-grade expectations.
  - Content not tailored ‚Äî irrelevant info wastes users‚Äô time.
  - Inconsistent experience ‚Äî differing design standards confuse users.
  - Low confidence in resolution ‚Äî bad past experience erodes trust.
- **User needs to solve impediments:**
  - Discoverable content ‚Äî matches user expectations.
  - Quality search ‚Äî smart results.
  - Personalized content ‚Äî role/location-based.
  - Consistent experience ‚Äî familiar structures.
  - Visible progress & trust ‚Äî confidence in resolution.
- **Key actions for self-service:**
  - Observe current state: use analytics, surveys, usability testing.
    - Look at the data
    - Get feedback at scale
    - Observe your users
  - Focus on Service Delivery: journey mapping, Flow Designer, Integration Hub, Robotic Process Automation, Service Level Management.
    - Map out the current state
    - Reduce "swivel chair work" through automation
    - Remove dead ends
    - Learn in the wild
  - Push info to users: design profiles, consolidate records, smart widgets.
  - do not follow the org structure - understand the users model: plain language, avoid jargon, logical structures.
  - users before providers: keep forms simple, avoid unnecessary questions, standardize variables.

### Collecting Input

- **Introduction**
  - A workflow is only as good as the inputs it receives ‚Äî input design must be accurate, efficient, and low-stress.
- **Four leading practices:**
  - ‚úÖ **Choose the right inputs** ‚Äî use form controls that match the data you need. Example: use correct variable types in Catalog Items, Table Builder, or Catalog Builder.
  - ‚úÖ **Pace the content** ‚Äî break long forms into clear sections, guide users step-by-step, and treat it like a conversation.
  - ‚úÖ **Assist the user** ‚Äî add smart defaults, helper text, annotations, or examples so users understand what‚Äôs needed.
  - ‚úÖ **Maintain consistency** ‚Äî standardize how questions are asked across forms, reuse question sets, and apply governance.
- **Common user impediments:**
  - Unclear questions ‚Äî users guess or skip, producing bad data.
  - Unknown response formats ‚Äî unclear input patterns block submission.
  - Form exhaustion ‚Äî long forms lower response quality.
  - Lack of knowledge ‚Äî questions assume knowledge users may not have.
  - Inconsistent experiences ‚Äî users waste effort re-learning form layouts.
- **Practical guidance:**
  - **Choose the right inputs:** match input type to the data (e.g., single choice, multiple choice, formatted fields).
  - **Pace the content:** use sections, clear instructions, and natural flow. Prepare users with upfront information.
  - **Assist the user:** provide examples, use annotations, give inline help, validate with clear messages.
  - **Maintain consistency:** set governance, train admins, reuse Templates and Variable Sets (Catalog Builder).
- **Resources:**
  - Read: [Web Form Design: Filling in the Blanks](https://www.lukew.com/resources/web_form_design.asp) ‚Äì foundational book on digital forms.
