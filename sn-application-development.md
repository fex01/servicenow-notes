### Application development concepts

- **Cloud-based application**
  - ServiceNow manages computing resources and provides the platform
  - Developers configure ServiceNow and extend functionality using JavaScript
  - Users access applications via a web browser (no installation)
  - Delivered via the internet
  - Built on an existing platform
  - Provides access to data
- **Why develop custom applications**
  - Replace outdated or inadequate business applications and processes
  - Extend the value of ServiceNow
  - Extend service delivery and management across enterprise departments
  - Increase automation and consolidate enterprise services
  - Address gaps where existing custom apps only partially meet business or user needs
  - Outcomes
    - Increased responsiveness
    - Increased productivity
    - Improved user satisfaction
- **Should I build it**
  - Good fit
    - Data modeled in a relational database
    - Request–fulfill process pattern
    - Form-based data interaction
    - Reporting requirements
    - Workflow / Flow Designer usage
    - Extendable via JavaScript
  - Bad fit
    - Unstructured data (audio, video)
    - Proprietary libraries without APIs
    - Multi-player or graphics-engine-based applications
    - No defined process flow
- **Custom application examples**
  - Timecard, Gift Card, Contract, Invoice, Accounts Payable
  - PO Reconciliation, IP Address Management, Document Workflow
  - Incident Response, Field Safety, Game/Venue Issue Management
  - Customer Feedback, Insurance Claims, Truck Maintenance
  - Lab Mouse Reports, Postal Equipment Management, Pig Lifecycle

### Scoped Application Model

- **Philosophy**
  - Applications should be uninstallable
  - Applications should not break the system
  - Applications should not break other applications
  - Applications should be self-contained
  - Dependencies must be clearly defined
  - Least-privilege access enforced
  - Scope isolates applications from each other
  - Out-of-scope access must be explicitly allowed
- **Evolution of scopes**
  - Pre-Fuji (≤ Dublin)
    - All applications built in Global scope
    - Deployed using Update Sets
  - Fuji (2014)
    - Scoped applications introduced
  - Geneva (2015)
    - Studio IDE introduced
    - Delegated Development introduced
  - Present
    - All new applications are scoped
    - Major apps (e.g., HR, CSM) rewritten as scoped
- **Scopes and records**
  - Global scope
    - Baseline applications
    - Legacy custom applications (no migration path)
  - Private scoped
    - Custom applications
  - Scope is immutable once saved
  - Platform warnings prevent accidental out-of-scope changes
  - Scope switching via temporary link or Application Picker
- **Scoped vs. Global**
  - Scoped applications
    - Separate namespace
    - Sandboxed for security and stability
    - Delegated Development support
    - Publishable to Application Repository
    - Restricted data access (even Admin access can be limited)
  - Global applications
    - All artifacts exist in Global
  - Artifacts
    - Access Controls, Business Rules, Script Includes, Tables, Client Scripts
  - Baseline access
    - Read access across app tables
    - No write/update/delete without explicit permission
- **Namespace**
  - Format: `x_{company_code}_{application_id}`
  - `x_` prefix required
  - Company code from `glide.appcreator.company.code` (2–5 characters)
  - Application name truncated as needed
  - Maximum length: 18 characters
  - Example: `x_acme_book_rooms`
  - Reference: [Application Scope](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_ApplicationScope.html&version=latest)
- **Delegated Development**
  - Allows non-admin users to develop, deploy, and delete scoped applications
  - Application-specific permissions
  - File-type access control
  - Instance-specific user roles
  - Optional access to security records and script fields
  - Managed in Studio
    - Application Details → App Settings (gear) → _Manage Developers_
  - Permissions set per application
- **Determining scope**
  - General rule
    - Use scoped applications whenever possible
  - Use scoped for
    - Custom applications
    - Utilities, integrations, services
    - Customizations to scoped applications
  - Use global when required
    - Legacy global customizations
    - Pre-scoping production applications
    - Base instance code changes
    - Required global resources unavailable to scopes
    - Excessive global dependencies

### Application Development vs. Deployment

- **Development**
  - Incremental work during build
  - Tool: Update Sets
  - Supports multiple work streams
- **Deployment**
  - Package completed functionality
  - Tools

  - Labs are sequential and interdependent
- **Required skills**
  - Administration
    - Forms, lists, users, Access Controls
    - Workflow / Flow Designer
    - Service Catalog and Record Producers
  - Scripting
    - Script type selection

    - Partial ES2022 support
  - ES5 Standards Mode
    - ES5 syntax and features
    - Native JSON support
  - Compatibility Mode
    - Pre-Helsinki and all Global scripts

### Create a custom application (Module 3.2)

- **App creation inputs (requirements → configuration)**
  - Application configuration
    - Name
    - Description
    - Scope (auto-generated)
  - Roles
    - Default created: Admin role + User role
    - Option: use defaults or assign existing roles
  - Tables
    - Option: existing table
    - Option: create new table
    - Option: extend existing table
    - Option (license-limited): upload spreadsheet/PDF to create table
  - Table configuration
    - Label
    - Auto-numbering
    - Manage access (Application Access settings)
  - Next steps after basic creation
    - ServiceNow Studio (add artifacts)
    - Flow Designer (automation)
    - Set up another app
- **Scope naming (namespace)**
  - Scope prefix appears on many artifacts
  - Constructed as `x_` + `<glide.appcreator.company.code>` + truncated application name
  - `glide.appcreator.company.code`
    - ServiceNow-set value (not user-changeable)
    - Typically 2–5 characters
    - Class example: `calta`

#### ServiceNow Studio usage and capabilities

- **Access Studio**
  - **App Engine > ServiceNow Studio**
- **Open an app in Studio**
  - Option 1: **App Engine > ServiceNow Studio** → select application
  - Option 2: **System Applications > My Company Applications** → select _Edit in ServiceNow Studio_
- **What Studio supports**
  - Open/edit app files in any scope (global or custom)
  - Tabbed navigation + app file navigator
  - Code search
  - Quick creation of scripts/files
  - Deployment via Update Sets or internal Application Repository
  - Manage global application files
  - Testing integration (opens ATF in a Studio tab)
- **What Studio does NOT support**
  - Push to external source control → use Update Sets
  - Script IP protection → manage project access
- **Working model**
  - Build in Studio
  - Use the application in the main ServiceNow UI
- New application defaults and configuration
  - **New application contains**
    - App details (type, scope, created date, `sys_id`)
    - Default roles: admin + user
    - Embedded Help Role Priority
  - **Scope truncation behavior**
    - Scope value can truncate app name
    - System may append numeric suffix to maintain uniqueness (increments if needed)
  - **Create application files**
    - In Studio: select _Create_ → _File_ → choose file type (pop-up selector)
    - Typical foundational artifacts
      - Tables
      - Access Controls
      - Modules
      - Forms

#### Data table choices and creation patterns

- **Decision importance**
  - Extend existing table to inherit built-in behavior (“for free”)
  - Create new table for full control of behavior
  - Applications commonly use multiple tables
    - Primary/base table(s) for core records
    - Reference/lookup tables for controlled values
- **Table options**
  - Extend a table
    - Copies base table structure + inherits behavior
    - Add new fields on child table
  - Create a table
    - Use when no suitable base table exists
  - Upload spreadsheet/PDF (App Engine Enterprise license only)
- **Add a scope-specific column to an existing table (no custom table)**
  - Studio → open app
  - _Create_ → _File_
  - Select _Table Column_ → _Continue_
  - Complete fields → _Submit_
  - Result: existing table gains an additional column in your application scope
- **Create a custom table by extending**
  - _Create_ → _File_ → _Table_ → _Continue_
  - Label → enter table name
  - Extends table → select base table
  - _Save_ (not Submit)
  - Columns tab → add fields
  - _Update_
- **Create a custom table from scratch**
  - _Create_ → _File_ → _Table_ → _Continue_
  - Label → enter table name
  - Extends table → leave empty
  - _Submit_
- **Inspect existing business logic on a table**
  - From list view → column context menu (ellipsis) → _Configure_ → _All_
  - Navigator search → `<table_name>.config`
- **Default fields on all new tables**
  - `sys_created_by` (string) – display name of user who inserted record
  - `sys_created_on` (glide_date_time) – timestamp on insert
  - `sys_id` (GUID) – unique record identifier
  - `sys_updated_on` (glide_date_time) – timestamp on update
  - `sys_updated_by` (string) – display name of last updater
  - `sys_mod_count` (numeric) – update count since creation
  - If Extensible=`true`
    - `sys_class_name` (system class name) – identifies child table that contains the record
- **Inherited fields (when extending)**
  - Child table inherits parent fields
  - Field is inherited when the Table column value differs from table Name
- **Extend vs create guidance**
  - Extend when
    - Similar table exists and built-in scripts/workflows are useful
    - Approval activities needed via Task-based approvals (non-User Approval activities require Task extension)
  - Create new when
    - No similar table exists
    - You want to implement behaviors yourself
    - Table is reference-only with seeded/sample data for lookup
  - Constraints
    - Parent table must be Extensible to extend it
    - Cannot extend system tables or database view tables

#### Application Access and cross-scope behavior

- **Application Access (runtime protection for app tables)**
  - Protects read/write/create/delete via
    - Scripts
    - Web service calls
  - Accessible
    - `This application scope only` (complete runtime protection)
    - `All application scopes` (allow access from other privately scoped apps)
  - Caller Access (cross-scope request handling)
    - `None`
    - `Caller Tracking`
    - `Caller Restriction`
  - Can read / create / update / delete
    - Controls whether scripts from other scopes can perform DB operations
    - Never applies to current application scope
  - Allow access to this table via web services
    - Allows other-scope scripts to call web services against the table
    - Calling user still needs table permissions
  - Allow configuration
    - Allows developers in other scopes to write scripts for this table
- **Cross-scope privileges (permission handshake)**
  - Use case: App B needs access to App A resources/data
  - Requirements (both sides)
    - App A: allow access via Application Access tab (enables requests)
    - App B: request via Cross-scope privilege record
  - Operational notes
    - Run all scripts during testing to generate required cross-scope privilege records
    - After publication, runtime requests require a valid cross-scope privilege record
  - Risk
    - Misconfiguration can expose sensitive data

#### Application menu and modules

- **Menu/module creation behavior**
  - Application menu created once a table exists in the scope
  - Module can be created when table is created
  - Default module name = plural of table name (editable)
  - Default module shows list of all records (no default records)
  - After adding menus/modules: reload the ServiceNow browser window
- **View modules**
  - Studio → navigator panel → expand _Module_ → select module
- **Create a module**
  - Studio → _Create_ → _File_
  - Application field = your application
  - File type: _Module (sys_app_module)_
  - _Continue_ → configure → _Submit_
- **Module configuration fields**
  - Title (module name)
  - Application Menu (defaults to current app)
  - Order (menu ordering)
  - Hint (tooltip)
  - Roles (restrict module access; blank → inherits application roles)
  - Active (show/hide module)
  - Override application menu roles (allow access even if user can’t see menu; module role still required)
  - Link type (controls destination)
  - Table (table accessed by module)
  - View Name (view to open)
  - Filter (list filtering)
  - Note: link type may require additional fields (Filter/Content Page/Arguments)

#### Scope visibility and avoiding scope mistakes

- **Studio scope indicators**
  - Current file scope shown bottom-left
  - Multiple scopes can be open in Studio
  - Best practice: verify scope before creating records
  - Preference: Organize tab groups by scope
    - Color-coded grouped tabs = same scope
    - Tabs without colors = global scope
  - Hover over tab to view file scope
- **Main UI scope pickers**
  - Scope menu (globe icon) available to users with roles permitting scope pickers
  - Application scope picker
    - Sets where changes apply (defaults to newly created application)
    - Reference: [Application Scope](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/c_ApplicationScope.html)
  - Update set picker (admin)

### Update sets during app development

- **Why use update sets during development**
  - Track configuration/file changes (version control concept)
  - Store customizations and rationale (why a change was made)
  - Export work-in-progress before a clone
  - Support SDLC traceability (stories, problems, bugs, enhancements)
  - Useful for
    - Baseline app customizations
    - Store app customizations
- **Mental model**
  - Create update set = start “recording”
  - Make changes = recorded into update set
  - Complete update set = stop “recording” and make retrievable
- **Create a new update set (Studio)**
  - Studio → Update Set widget → _+New_
  - Name → _Save_ → _Apply_
- **Complete an update set**
  - Studio home → Deployment tab → select update set → State=`Complete`
- **Practical usage pattern (example)**
  - After creating new app: _Publish to Update Set_ to capture baseline
  - Daily: save progress in update set
  - End of sprint: publish to Application Repository
  - Final product for external sale: publish to ServiceNow Store
- **Recommendations**
  - Design the data model before creating app tables
  - Extend existing tables where possible to inherit functionality
  - Choose deployment method based on audience (update set vs repository vs store)
  - Add documentation/comments throughout development where possible

## Application Forms

- **Module outcomes**
  - Create/modify tables
  - Design/create forms
  - Create view: Desktop
  - Write/test/debug client-side + server-side scripts
  - Complete an update set
  - Publish updated app to the Application Repository
- **User story**
  - Create appropriate fields, lists, forms, and views to ensure a positive user experience

- **Default lists/forms behavior**
  - New table (no parent)
    - Gets a default list and default form
  - Extended table
    - Default list/form inherits parent table fields + layout
    - Example: extending `Task` drives inherited list/form content

- **Add fields to a table (not the base table)**
  - Label convention: capitalize only first letter of the first word
  - Steps (Studio)
    - Open application in ServiceNow Studio
    - Open target table record
    - Select _Add new field_
    - Set Column label
    - Set Type
    - Configure remaining column parameters
    - Select _Save_

- **Field type selection (avoid data loss)**
  - Changing field type later can cause data loss → choose carefully up front
  - Avoid free-form text unless required
    - Do not use string for dates
    - Do not use string for people/object references
  - Prefer constrained/typed fields
    - Choice list + Reference to limit values
    - Date/Date-Time for correct formatting
  - Common field types
    - Date/Time (calendar widget)
    - Reference (records from another table)
    - True/False (checkbox)
    - Decimal (e.g., `12.34`)
    - String
  - Reference: [Database field types](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=r_DatabaseFieldTypes.html&version=latest)

- **When to create new fields**
  - Prefer reuse when possible (especially when extending a table)
  - Options and tradeoffs
    - Use existing fields unchanged
      - Pro: no maintenance
      - Con: may not match process perfectly
    - Retitle existing fields (change Label)
      - Pro: label matches process
      - Con: column name ≠ label (can confuse)
    - Consolidate fields
      - Pro: simpler form
      - Con: risk oversimplifying requirements
  - Label change scope
    - Changing a field label affects only the current table (not parent tables)

- **Delete fields**
  - Can delete user-defined fields
  - Cannot delete inherited fields
  - Deleting a field does not delete table records
  - Steps
    - Table Columns list → select gear icon for field → select Delete field icon → confirm Delete → _Save_
  - Note (Table Builder)
    - To delete a column, delete existing data in that column first

- **Form design (UX rules of thumb)**
  - Keep forms short; users read top → bottom
  - Place key identifiers (record number/name) at top
  - Use sections to break up long forms
  - Use two-column layouts near top of a form/section
  - Use full-width single-column for long text fields
  - Use meaningful labels; avoid ambiguous labels like “Date”
  - Use Hint/Annotation/Help for longer guidance (keep labels short)
  - Differentiate desktop vs mobile needs (validate on tablet/smartphone)

- **Form sections as tabs (user preference)**
  - Tabs appear only when there are 2+ sections
  - Default platform behavior: sections displayed as tabs
  - Disable tabbed sections
    - User avatar → _Preferences_ → _Display_ → disable “display form sections as tabs” (slider left)

- **Change a field label (Form Builder)**
  - Studio → Form section → open form
  - Select field in Form Builder
  - Right-side config panel → Label
  - Select _Save_

- **Tooltips (field Hint)**
  - Keep to ~one line (brief, quick visibility)
  - Steps
    - Open table form (main UI)
    - Right-click field → _Configure Label_
    - Set Hint (mouse-over text)
    - _Save_

- **Real-time user feedback (client-side)**
  - Use Client Scripts + UI Action scripts for targeted feedback
  - Common APIs
    - `g_form.showFieldMsg()` (message under field, blue background)
    - `g_form.addInfoMessage()` (top-of-form message, blue background)
    - `g_form.addErrorMessage()` (top-of-form message, red background)
    - `alert()` (OK dialog)
    - `confirm()` (OK/Cancel dialog)

- **Field Styles (visual emphasis)**
  - Use tasteful, businesslike styling
  - Create a Style record (Studio)
    - _Create_ → _File_ → _Style_ → _Continue_
    - Set Table + Field name
    - Optional: Value (for styling a specific choice value)
    - Style field: CSS commands
    - _Submit_
  - Examples (CSS)
    - `font-weight:bold;`
    - `text-decoration:underline;`
    - `font-style:italic;`
    - `text-align:center;` / `text-align:right;`
    - `font-size:18px;`
    - `background-color:blue;`
    - `color:yellow;`

- **Form Builder (what it’s for)**
  - Add/configure form elements (fields, formatters, embedded lists)
  - Select views and apply layouts to views
  - Apply policies/rules and preview changes
  - Access
    - Record → Configure → _Form Builder_ (opens new window)
    - Also available via Related Links / Table Builder (Forms tab)

- **Views (form/list variants)**
  - View = saved configuration of fields + order for same record (form or list)
  - Use case: show the right fields to the right audience (ESS, ITIL, mobile)
  - Naming
    - Name = database name
    - Title = user-friendly label
    - Default view shows no view name next to form title
  - Scripting benefit
    - Client Scripts and UI Policy scripts can run selectively by View
  - Permission
    - Users need `view_changer` role to change views

- **Work with views (Form Builder)**
  - Create view
    - Form Builder → Select a form view → _+ Add_ → enter name → _Create_ → configure
  - Modify view
    - Select view from “Select a form view” → configure
  - Duplicate view
    - Ellipses next to current view → _Duplicate this form view_ → name → _Create_ → configure
  - Delete view
    - Main UI → **System UI > Forms** → filter by table + view → open → _Delete_ → confirm

- **View Rules (server-enforced view selection)**
  - Forces a view from the server (URL query string cannot override)
  - Conditions
    - Condition builder (contextual user/record relationship)
    - JavaScript condition
    - Server-side JavaScript can set `answer` to the view name
    - Complex logic can use `switch/case`

- **Scripting in ServiceNow (why)**
  - Enhance user experience
  - Extend/add functionality
  - Common examples
    - Set cursor focus on load
    - Send notifications
    - Log/debug output
    - Validate data
    - Prompt users (alerts/confirmations/messages)
    - Add widgets to forms/lists
  - Reference: [Scripting](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-api-reference/page/script/topic/c_Script.html)

- **Client-side vs server-side execution**
  - Client-side (browser)
    - UI Policies
    - Client Scripts
  - Server-side (platform)
    - Business Rules
    - Scheduled Jobs
    - Script Actions
  - Each script type has its own trigger (“when”) + logic (“what”)
    - Trigger fields vary by script type
    - Description: document purpose/requirement/author context
    - Messages: localization keys (maps to `sys_ui_message`)
    - Script: logic executed when trigger/conditions are met

- **UI Policies (client-side form behavior)**
  - Typical actions (no code required for basics)
    - Mandatory, Visible, Read-only, Hide fields (via UI Policy Actions)
  - Performance guidance
    - Prefer Condition Builder over scripts
  - Re-evaluation limitation
    - Conditions re-check only when user manually changes a field on a form
    - Not evaluated for changes via UI Action/context menu/import/web services/list editor
    - Use Data Policies (non-scriptable) to enforce mandatory/read-only off-form
  - Create UI Policy (key fields)
    - Table, Application (scope), Active
    - Short description (pseudo-name; appears in debugging)
    - Order (executes low → high)
    - When to Apply conditions (Condition Builder)
    - Save required before Actions/Script fields appear
  - UI Policy Actions
    - Field name
    - Mandatory / Visible / Read only
    - Clear field value (checkbox)
  - Advanced view fields
    - Global (all views) vs View (specific)
    - Reverse if false + Execute if false
    - On load (form load + change)
    - Inherit (applies to extended tables)
  - UI Policy scripting (Advanced view)
    - Run scripts → Execute if true / Execute if false
    - Can handle complex conditions, data changes, show/hide sections (sections require scripts)

- **Client Scripts (browser)**
  - Use cases
    - React to field changes, validate values, set attributes, show/hide sections, modify choices
  - Types
    - `onChange` (field value changes)
    - `onLoad` (form load; use sparingly—impacts load time)
    - `onSubmit` (save/update/submit validation; may lead to form reload → onLoad runs again)
  - Trigger/config fields
    - Name (use consistent naming scheme)
    - Table
    - UI Type (Desktop/Tablet, Mobile, or both)
    - Type (onChange/onLoad/onSubmit/onCellEdit)
    - Field Name (required for onChange/onCellEdit)
    - Active
    - Inherited (apply to extended tables)
    - Global vs View (scope to specific view; script only acts on fields in that view)

- **UI Policies vs Client Scripts (selection cues)**
  - Prefer UI Policies when Condition Builder can handle it (better performance)
  - Use Client Scripts when you need
    - onSubmit validation
    - prior value access
    - list field value changes
    - complex scripted logic not suited to policy actions

- **Client-side APIs**
  - `g_form` (GlideForm)
    - Form/field methods (desktop/tablet vs mobile differences)
  - `g_user` (GlideUser)
    - Current user properties + role checks
    - Impersonation affects results (runs client-side)

- **Script editor assistance**
  - Ctrl+Space for contextual help/autocomplete in editor
  - Reference: [Syntax editor keyboard shortcuts and actions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-api-reference/page/script/general-scripting/reference/r_SyntxEdtrKybrdSrtctsActn.html)
- **API documentation**
  - Developer site: `developer.servicenow.com`
  - Navigation: Reference → APIs → select API type → select class → select method

- **Scoped vs global client scripts (API availability differences)**
  - Scoped scripts wrapped in an IIFE → some APIs modified/unavailable
  - Property to enable certain globals per application
    - `glide.script.block.client.globals`=`false` (enables some blocked globals)
    - Exception: GlideRecord cannot be re-enabled client-side
      - Use GlideAjax instead of GlideRecord client-side
  - Inaccessible APIs (scoped client)
    - GlideRecord, `window`, `document`
    - Prototype: `$`, `$$`
    - jQuery: `jQuery`, `$j`
    - `$F` (Sizzle shortcut)
  - Modified APIs
    - GlideAjax, GlideForm, GlideDialogWindow

- **Server-side script types (common triggers)**
  - Access Controls (operation-based)
  - Script Actions (event-driven)
  - Business Rules (DB access: Insert/Update/Delete/Query; Before/After/Display/Async)
  - Script Includes (on call)
  - Scheduled Jobs (schedule-driven)
  - UI Actions (user click)
  - Workflow / Flow (condition-driven)
- **Server-side API references**
  - Scoped: <https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/xanadu/server>
  - Global: <https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/xanadu/server_legacy/>

- **Business Rules (execution order matters)**
  - Server-side automation triggered by database access
  - Additional reference: [Types of Business Rules](https://www.servicenow.com/community/itsm-forum/types-of-business-rules-with-example/m-p/712624)

- **Client ↔ server data passing**
  - Display Business Rule populates `g_scratchpad` (values must be strings)
  - Client scripts can read `g_scratchpad`
  - Note: `g_scratchpad` not available on mobile

- **ServiceNow recommendations**
  - Create as few new fields as possible
  - Design lists/forms for usability (fields + sections)
  - Use scripts to enhance UX (but keep client logic efficient)
  - Test on tablet + smartphone (not only desktop)
  - Use Application Repository to move applications between instances

## Controlling Access

### Access Control

- **Purpose (user story)**
  - Ensure only appropriate users can access or manipulate data
- **Access can be restricted at**
  - Application menus
  - Modules
  - Records (rows)
  - Fields (columns)
- **User behavior to expect**
  - Users may attempt access via:
    - **System Definition > Tables** (table visibility ≠ record access)
    - `<table_name>.list` in Application Navigator
  - Outcomes when access is restricted
    - List loads but hides rows → “Number of rows removed… by Security constraints”
    - Page blocked → “Security constraints prevent access to request page”

- **Security model**
  - Deny by default
  - Access Control rules define required permissions for an operation

- **Menu access (role-based)**
  - Without role → menu not visible in navigator
  - With role → menu visible
  - Configure (Studio)
    - Application Menu → select menu → _Edit User Roles_ (pencil) → move roles to Selected → _Done_ → _Save_

- **Module access (role-based)**
  - Without role → module not visible
  - With role → module visible (record visibility still depends on ACLs)
  - Configure (Studio)
    - Module → select module → Visibility → _Edit User Roles_ (pencil) → assign roles → _Done_ → _Save_
  - `Override application menu roles`
    - Allows access to module even if user can’t see the application menu
    - User may then see the menu plus the authorized module(s)

- **Record and field ACL management**
  - Requirement to create/edit ACLs in Studio
    - Must elevate to `security_admin`
    - If elevated but still blocked, _Save_ any application file to refresh Studio permissions
  - CRUD ACLs
    - Basic table CRUD ACLs can be generated automatically during table creation
    - Description auto-populates when ACLs are created
  - Modify an ACL (high-level)
    - Elevate Role → `security_admin`
    - Open app in Studio → Security → Access Control → select rule → edit → _Save_
  - Create vs write default behavior
    - Wildcard create (`*.*` create) reuses write permissions
    - Create permissions == write unless an explicit create ACL is defined

- **Find the right ACLs to edit**
  - List view → Configure → _Security Rules_ (shows evaluated ACLs for a record)
  - Customize the ACL list to show **Description** for faster identification

- **Row vs field ACL types**
  - `table.None`
    - Row (record) access gate for list/form
    - If denied at row level → field ACLs cannot grant access
  - `table.field`
    - Secures a single field
    - If row allowed but field denied → field not visible
  - `table.*`
    - Secures all fields without field-specific ACLs
    - Acts as a broad include/exclude control

- **Using `table.None`, `table.field`, `table.*` (practical patterns)**
  - Allow both roles full row access
    - `table.None` Read includes RoleA OR RoleB
  - Deny one role from a specific field (without impacting other fields)
    - `table.None` Read includes RoleA OR RoleB
    - `table.u_field` Read includes RoleA only
  - Make RoleB see only one field while RoleA sees everything
    - Use `table.*` carefully (it can exclude other roles from all non-explicit fields)
    - Successful pattern requires field ACL to include both roles when needed
      - `table.None` Read: RoleA OR RoleB
      - `table.*` Read: RoleA
      - `table.u_field_3` Read: RoleA OR RoleB
- **Star guidance**
  - Want to **exclude** many fields easily → use `table.*`
  - Want to **include** fields selectively without broad exclusion → avoid `table.*`
- **Learning resources**
  - [Introduction to Access Controls](https://nowlearning.servicenow.com/lxp/en/now-platform/introduction-to-access-controls?id=learning_course_prev&course_id=3c13324dc3de7d541ac0f60f05013187)

- **ACL evaluation order**
  - ![ACL Matching](./attachments/sn-acl-matching.png)
  - Table-level evaluated first (most specific → most general)
    - If fail table ACL → deny all fields
  - Field-level evaluated next (most specific → most general)
    - If pass table ACL but fail field ACL → deny that field
  - Field-level processing stops at first successful match
  - Object hierarchy lookup (example pattern)
    - Explicit rule on self → explicit field rule on parent(s) → wildcard on self → wildcard on parent(s)
  - Example search path for `incident.number`
    - Table-level (`table.none`): `incident` → `task` → `*`
    - Field-level (`table.field`, `table.*`): `incident.number` → `task.number` → `*.number` → `incident.*` → `task.*` → `*.*`

    - `canCreate()`, `canRead()`, `canWrite()`, `canDelete()`

### Application access (cross-scope runtime protection)

- **What it is**
  - Table-by-table runtime protection evaluated in addition to ACLs
  - Controls out-of-scope access via
    - Scripts (server-side)
    - Web services API
    - CRUD permissions on table data
- **Key behavior**
  - Applies to server-side scripts from other scopes
  - Does not apply to scripts executing in the same scope
  - If `Accessible from`=`All application scopes`
    - Default: read-only allowed
    - Web service + configuration options become selectable only in this mode
- **Runtime enforcement**
  - Unauthorized script access is blocked without throwing runtime errors
  - Disallowed operations are skipped; instance continues normally

- **Web service access only**
  - Prevents user UI login
  - `Internal Integration user` can bypass Web Services Security (WSS) system property setting
  - If unchecked → user cannot access the data

- **Allow configuration (cross-scope artifact creation)**
  - Allows other scopes to create configuration records for the table, e.g.
    - Dictionary entries
    - UI Actions
    - Client Scripts
  - Note: other metadata types can impact out-of-scope tables where `Can read` is allowed
  - Reference: [Example: granting access to configuration records](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/c_ExampleGrantingAccessToConfigRecs.html)

- **Caller Access (restricted caller tracking/approval)**
  - Options
    - `-None-` (approved/denied based on `Accessible from`)
    - Caller Tracking
      - Auto-approved
      - Logged in Restricted Caller Access table
      - Status=`Allowed`
    - Caller Restriction
      - Manual approval required
      - Logged in Restricted Caller Access table
      - Status=`Requested`
  - Requires plugin
    - Scoped Application Restricted Caller Access (`com.glide.scope.access.restricted_caller`)
  - Requires role
    - Application admin or `admin` to set

### Protection policies (IP protection on install/migration)

- **Purpose**
  - Protect artifact logic (IP) when:
    - Migrated via Application Repository
    - Installed from ServiceNow Store
  - Does not restrict developers on the dev instance from viewing/editing artifacts
  - Not applied when migrating via Update Sets
- **Applies to**
  - UI Actions
  - Script Includes
- **Options**
  - `-None-` (viewable + editable)
  - Read-only (viewable, not editable)
  - Protected (not viewable)
- **Dev instance guidance**
  - Use roles/ACLs to restrict artifact visibility/editing (not protection policies)

### ServiceNow recommendations

- Plan security early in development
- Create user + admin roles for application modules
- Prefer role-based controls for maintainability
- Avoid client-side role checks (e.g., `g_user.hasRole()`) for security decisions
- Test features against security settings
  - Impersonate different users to validate expected access
- Use Application Access to control what tables/artifacts are available to other scopes

## Automation

### Flow Designer

- **Purpose**
  - Automate request processing (repeatable, error-free)
- **Flow building blocks**
  - Properties
  - Trigger (record-based or time-based)
  - Action(s) (operations; reusable)
  - Optional conditions (control when/how actions run)
  - Data Panel (variables as “pills”; drag/drop into inputs/outputs)
- **Trigger types (examples)**
  - Application: MetricBase, Service Catalog
  - Record: Created, Updated, Created or Updated
  - Scheduled: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Run Once, Repeat
- **Create a flow (Studio)**
  - _Create_ → Application set correctly → Automation → _Flow_ → _Continue_ (opens Flow Designer tab)
- **Testing (built-in)**
  - Manual tests prompt for input data and run the flow (even if trigger conditions are not met)
  - No rollback; generates execution records + flow context (runtime values/state)
  - Use non-production instances
- **Execution details**
  - After test: “View the execution details”
  - More actions (⋮) → _Executions_
  - Docs: [Flow execution details](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-build-workflows/page/administer/flow-designer/concept/flow-execution-details.html)

### Integration Hub

- **Purpose**
  - Extends Flow Designer with low/no-code integrations; reusable integration actions
- **Requirement**
  - Plugin: `com.glide.hub.integrations`
- **Spokes**
  - Scoped apps that package Flow Designer actions for a system/record type
  - Activated with their parent application (e.g., Visual Task Board → VTB Spoke)
  - Examples (default): Benchmarks, Connect, Customer Service, Field Service, ITSM, Security Operations, Visual Task Board
  - Some spokes require Integration Hub subscription
  - Docs: [Integration Hub Spokes List](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-integrate-applications/page/administer/integrationhub/reference/spokes-list.html)

### Application properties (configurable settings)

- **Purpose**
  - Central admin-managed configuration values; retrievable in scripts
- **Constraint**
  - No properties for reference fields → use reference tables instead
- **Build workflow**
  - Create System Property Category → add properties → set order → expose via module
- **System Property Category**
  - Name appears in URL (avoid special characters; spaces allowed)
  - Title renders at top of properties page (supports HTML/links)
- **Property setup**
  - Typical: admin-configurable
  - Use `Ignore cache` to avoid stale cached values
  - References
    - [Ignore Cache Explained](https://www.servicenow.com/community/developer-blog/ignore-cache-checkbox-on-system-property-lt-sys-properties-gt/ba-p/2920941)
    - [When to Use Ignore Cache](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1000746)
- **Ordering**
  - Properties display lowest→highest `Order`
- **Properties module**
  - Create Module [`sys_app_module`] that opens the properties UI
  - Set Read/Write roles = application admin role
  - Arguments syntax
    - `system_properties_ui.do?sysparm_title=<title>&sysparm_category=<category_name>`
    - `%20` optional for spaces
  - Optional Separator module (Arguments text appears on separator line; no title → renders as a line)

### Scheduled Script Executions (time-based scripts)

- **Purpose**
  - Run server-side logic on a schedule (not user/record-change triggered)
- **Trigger configuration**
  - `Run` sets periodicity; 24-hour time; available date/day/time fields depend on Run
  - Time zone behavior
    - No TZ specified → scheduler uses the scheduling user’s time zone
    - `Use System Time Zone` → uses instance time zone
- **Execution characteristics**
  - Server-side; no `current/previous` record context by default
  - Condition Script variables available to the main script
- **Testing**
  - _Execute Now_ available only after saving
- **Visibility**
  - **System Scheduler > Scheduled Jobs > Today's Scheduled Jobs**
  - **System Scheduler > Scheduled Jobs > Scheduled Jobs**
  - Ready (red) = overdue (Next action time passed); typically runs soon unless delay is large

### Events (Event Queue + decoupled responses)

- **Definition**
  - Event = entry in Event Queue; requires response logic to do work
- **Workflow**
  - Register Event → generate Event → respond (Email Notification and/or Script Action)
- **Register (Event Registry)**
  - Key fields
    - Suffix / Event name (auto)
    - Table
    - Priority (lower = higher)
    - Queue (blank=default; custom queues lowercase_with_underscores)
    - Description (keep accurate as meaning changes)
    - Caller Access (restricted caller access)
- **Generate (server-side)**
  - `gs.eventQueue("<event_name>", object, parm1, parm2);`
  - `object`: `current`, `previous`, or GlideRecord
  - Conventions if parms unused: `parm1`=`gs.getUserID()`, `parm2`=`gs.getUserName()`
- **Inspect**
  - **System Logs > Events**
    - Created vs Processed, duration (ms), state, queue, parm1/parm2 resolved values

### Email Notifications (outbound email)

- **Triggers**
  - Record insert/update OR Event fired (Events optional for notifications)
- **Core fields**
  - Name (use naming standard), Table, Category (avoid Uncategorized), Description
  - Type (EMAIL/Meeting invitation), Active, Digest
  - Send when: Triggered / Event is fired / Record is inserted or updated
  - Conditions, Weight
- **Weight rules**
  - Same record + same recipients → highest weight sent
  - Same highest non-zero weight → all with that value sent
  - Weight `0` → always sent
- **Recipients**
  - Users (users or any email), Groups, Users/groups in field
  - Advanced: Exclude delegates, Send to event creator, Event parm1/parm2 contains recipient, Subscribable
  - Testing prerequisite: impersonate user → Preferences → Notifications > General → Allow Notifications active
- **Content**
  - Email template (Subject inherited; template Message replaced by notification Message)
  - Dynamic values
    - `${field}` (dot-walk: `${ref.field}`)
    - `${event.parm1}`, `${event.parm2}`
  - SMS alternate (140 chars)
  - Size limit: 26 MB incl. MIME encoding (attachments expand ~137%)
  - Docs: [Notification variables](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=notification-variables.html&version=latest)
- **Record links**
  - Triggering: `${URI}` (LINK), `${URI_REF}` (display value)
  - Related: `${ref.URI}`, `${ref.URI_REF}`
- **Test**
  - _Preview Notification_ (pick Event Creator + Preview Record; review recipients/subject/body)

### Script Actions (respond to Events)

- **Purpose**
  - Server-side logic triggered by Event occurrence
- **Objects**
  - `current` (from `gs.eventQueue()` object)
  - `event.parm1`, `event.parm2`
- **Config**
  - Name, Event name, Active
  - Condition Script (must be true to execute)
  - Script (server-side)

### Script Includes (reusable server-side library)

- **Purpose**
  - Reusable server-side JavaScript functions; not executed unless called
  - Centralizes logic for maintainability/debugging
  - `initialize()` runs on instantiation; commonly loads properties via `gs.getProperty(<name>, <default>)`
- **Naming rules**
  - Script Include name must match class name
  - Allowed: letters + numbers; not allowed: spaces + special characters
- **Protection policy (Store installs only)**
  - `--None--` (view/edit), Read-only (view), Protected (hidden)
- **Note**
  - Legacy `gs.include('ScriptIncludeName')` may appear in baseline scripts; explicit include no longer required

### Recommended patterns

- Prefer Flow Designer/Workflow for process orchestration; reserve scripts for gaps/complexity
- Use application properties for admin-managed configuration
- Use Scheduled Script Executions + Events + Notifications for time-based automation + messaging
- Store reusable server-side logic in Script Includes (document params/returns)
