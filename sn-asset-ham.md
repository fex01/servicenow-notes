### Introduction

- separately licensed Hardware Asset Management (HAM)
- differentiation
  - **Asset**:
    - tracked throughout its life for financial, contractual, and lifecycle data
    - procurement, receiving, maintenance, or retirement
    - track inventory
    - manage associated license, warranty, lease, or maintenance contracts
    - track monetary value or incurred costs
    - document the service status, end-of-life, and/or decommission
    - who is using it and/or how often it is being used
    - examples: HW, SW Licenses, Data, Buildings
  - **IT Asset**: technology component managed throughout its lifecycle for value, cost, contractual compliance, and usage
    - created or acquired, used to support business activities, managed financially and operationally, and then retired or expired at the end of their useful life
    - records stored in an asset repository and include all relevant data, such as asset tag, model category, model, depreciation
    - examples: SW Entitlement, router, server, switch
  - **CI**: track operational and relationship information
    - may have financial values assigned to it; however
    - does not have any depreciation linked to it
    - stored in the CMDB
    - purpose:
      - monitor and track its technical specifications
      - associated with an Incident, Problem, or Change record
      - relationship to other items
    - examples: servers, routers, switches, websites, storage devices
  - **Asset vs CI**:
    - overlap: Servers, Workstations / desktops, Enterprise network HW / appliances, SAN enterprise & local storage devices
    - organization may decide to track a component as just an asset, just a CI, or as both
- risks without HAM: wasted resources, limited visibility, inaccurate inventory, lack of accountability, and fulfillment or service delays
- HAM purpose: **mitigate risk** and **optimize cost**
  - What hardware assets do you have?
  - Where are they?
  - Who uses them?
  - How are they used?
  - How are they configured?
  - What do they cost?
  - What value to they deliver?
- HAM definition: stewardship of IT assets from planning through sunset
  - also:
    - set of business practices that joins financial, contractual, procurement, and inventory functions to support the lifecycle management and strategic decision-making for assets in an IT environment

- ITSM: configuration and delivery of IT services to users
- Goals of IT asset management (ITAM)
  - improve productivity: new hire process, asset requisition, share asset data, HW refresh
  - financial reporting: accurate and automated depreciation, accurate tax calculation, charge-back costs, project accounting
  - cost optimization: optimize contracts, standardize assets, employee separation, avoid penalities
  - decision support: asset reporting, asset dashboard, ad-hoc queries, data integration
- IT HW Asset Lifecycle
  - 1. Request: LC begins with a plan or a request - someone needs an asset to achieve a goal
  - 2. Procure: fulfillment by existing stock or through procurement from a vendor
  - 3. Receive: process
  - 4. Stock: process
  - operational phase:
    - 5. Deploy
    - 6. Monitor
    - 7. Support
    - 8. MAC: Move, add, and change
  - 9. Dispose
