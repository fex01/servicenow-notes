  - Other portals (e.g., Service Portal) do **not** include KM Service Portal features by default

- **Redirection Option**

  - To redirect legacy V3 UI article views to KM Service Portal:
    - Set the system property `sn_km_portal.glide.knowman.serviceportal.enable_redirect = true`

- **Feature Differences**

  - Default Service Portal lacks:
    - Filter facets beyond category
    - Advanced KM widgets (e.g., sort configuration, feedback enhancements)

  - Default indicator sources provided by the plugin; additional sources can be created:
    - Navigate: `Performance Analytics > Indicator Sources`
    - Roles required: `admin`, `pa_admin`, or `pa_data_collector`
    - Avoid duplicate sources; changing later affects existing data

- **Key Indicator Elements**

  - **Frequency**: How often indicators are displayed (Daily, Weekly, Monthly); independent from data collection schedule
  - **Direction**: Improvement direction (Minimize or Maximize)
  - **Unit**: Measurement unit (Number, %, Days, $, etc.)
  - **Aggregate**: Calculation method (Count, Sum, Average, Min, Max, Count distinct)
  - **Conditions**: Additional filters applied at the indicator level; case-sensitive and complement indicator source conditions
  - **Breakdowns**: Group or filter indicator scores by specific attributes (e.g., Category, Priority) for detailed analysis
