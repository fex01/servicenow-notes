    - e.g., "incidents updated last week"

  - **Specify Type**: Force visualization type ("as list", "as bar chart", "as pie chart")

    - e.g., "problems by priority as pie chart"

    - Choose existing Data Source (e.g., Incidents.Open: Active=true).
    - Create new Data Source via UI Action:

      1. Define filter (e.g., Priority = High/Critical).
      2. Save as new Data Source.

    - Leverage existing Data Source directly in reports.

- External Data Import

  - Import Excel data into temporary ServiceNow table.
  - Import file requirements:

    - First row: Column names.
    - Max size: 2 MB; max columns: 25.
    - Expiration & visibility required.

  - Expiration options: 1-2 weeks, 1-3-6 months, 1 year.
