# Incident Management

## Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

- questions:
  - agreed times for **Response** and **Resolution** for each priority?
  - different Standards (times) for different Services? (Service Levels, e.g. Gold, Silver, ...)
- Best Practices:
  - consumer focused: no team specific SLA times
  - predefined example SLAs: **All > Service Level Management > SLA > SLA Definitions**
    - Priority 1 resolution (1 hour)
    - Priority 5 response (40 hours)
  - Schedules fÃ¼r business hours: **All > System Scheduler > Schedules > Schedules**
    - 24 x 7
    - 8-5 weekdays excluding holidays (floating time zones)
- Schedules:
  - based on SLA Timezone source
  - default: callers time zone
