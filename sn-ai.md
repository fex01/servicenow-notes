## Fundamentals

### AI Approaches

- **Artificial Intelligence**
  - Replicates human or near-human intelligence in machines
  - Encompasses both ML and Deep Learning
- **Machine Learning (ML)**
  - Uses data + algorithms to build predictive models
  - Models describe relationships between variables
- **Deep Learning**
  - Subset of ML using neural networks
  - Builds layers of parameterized functions to mimic brain-like decision-making

### What is Generative AI?

- AI that creates new, realistic content based on learned data
- Can generate:
  - Text
  - Images
  - Audio
  - Video
- Works by using algorithms to generate data from existing data

## Value and Impact

- **Benefits**:

  - Cost and productivity improvements
    - Automates tasks
    - Reduces operational costs
    - Reallocates human effort to strategic work
  - Improved customer service

    - Broad human impact across professions and communities

- **Limitations and Risks**:
  - Difficulty adapting to new circumstances
    - Models require continuous fine-tuning to remain accurate
    - Struggle to generalize well in unfamiliar or dynamic environments
  - Harmful bias
    - Models may replicate and amplify biases in training data
    - Without safeguards, outputs may reflect harmful stereotypes
    - Requires governance policies and monitoring tools
  - Intellectual property rights
    - Content may be based on copyrighted materials without attribution
    - Potential leakage of confidential or proprietary information
    - Legal and ethical boundaries for content usage remain unclear
  - Lack of transparency
    - Model internals and training data are often opaque
    - Difficult to explain or trace how an output was generated
    - Reduces trust and confidence in enterprise adoption
  - New cybersecurity dangers
    - AI can be exploited by attackers to bypass security layers
    - Threat actors may weaponize generative AI tools
    - AI systems themselves may become attack surfaces
  - Potential problems with accuracy and appropriateness
    - Risk of hallucinations (confident but false output)
    - May generate misleading or unverified information
    - Must validate outputs before public or operational use
